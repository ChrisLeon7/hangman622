# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

The user is asked to guess a letter, and the game will reply either stating it was a good guess, or highlighting that the guess is not valid. whenever this happens, make sure to guess a single character.
